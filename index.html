    <!-- Change the src to your radio stream.
      The source you are trying to stream must be set to allow cross origin sharing. 
      This means that a web domain other than the one your radio stream is hosted on
      can access and use the sound file.
      If you plug in your stream URL and nothing plays, chances are you need to allow
      cross origin sharing on your radio server. This can likely be acheived simply by 
      getting the latest version of Icecast or Shoutcast for your stream.-->
