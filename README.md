# radioJS
Used for analyzing the audio of an Internet radio stream.

Includes an HTML document to get you started. Simply change the source of the <audio> to your desired radio stream URL. WKNC Raleigh's HD-1 stream is used in the example.
Also includes a basic example of making a circle grow to the results of analyzing the audio. Uses P5JS for the graphics. 

To run this, simply open index.html in a web browser.

Auto play has been disabled in Chrome and now requires user interaction to start the stream. Clicking the canvas starts the audio stream.
